# Star Wars Empire at War - Forces of Corruption Modding Editor

The idea creating an universal modding tool for Forces of Corruption was settled a long time ago in 2013. Since then I'm trying to get the idea into a running program. Unfortunately my time was very limited and the general focus was on working on Republic at War. During the 2 and a half years now I created a few  unreleased version of the editor but they never got as close as I wanted. The idea itself however never died out. I created an UI-Framework to challenge myself whether I'd be able to perform such a huge project. Now at University my final module before my bachelor thesis is to perform a project of my choice. I always wanted to combine modding with university and I took the opportunity and asked my professors for support. The Project got approved which means I'll awake this first idea, but this time I plan to do some essential changes. 

1.) My first attempts on the editors were quiet bad programmed. With each day, I got better, but still not good enough. This time I decided to put some more work into planing the software first before writing some code. 
2.) Moving to GitHub offers several advantages but the best thing is, that everyone who wants to jump in, can code with me.
3.) The main reason to move to GitHub however was the way it allows community communication. The goal is to create a Community-Tool for the Community from the Community. So anyone who wants to help, whether he knows much about modding/programming or not is kindly invited to support. 

While the Editor will be supported by my university please note, that I'll get marked for this. So you helping me with coding would be very kind but not necessary as the code has to done by me alone. After that I can add anyone as a contributor who wants to.

For more detailed information about the capability and functions the editor will offer please visit the wiki. From time to time I'll document everything there.

Beside creating the program itself I opened the wiki. Everyone who wants to add some useful information about modding can write some stuff.
